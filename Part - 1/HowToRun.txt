Steps to run the code:

There are two python files - modelIMDB.py and TransactionError.py.

—> modelIMDB.py 
	
	—> Set the variable values at the top of the code before running:
		TO CONNECT TO DATABASE:
			host: hostname
			dbname: database name
			user: username
			password: password
			port: port for POSTGRESQL server

		FOR FILE ACCESS:
			fileTitleBasics : file path for Title.Basics IN GZIP format
			fileTitleRatings : file path for Title.Ratings IN GZIP format
			fileNameBasicsTSV : file path for Name.Basics IN TSV format
			fileTitlePrincipalsTSV : file path for TitlePrincipals IN TSV format
	
	—> Output in console also shows time taken for each step.

—> TransactionError.py

	—> Set the variable values at the top of the code before running:
		TO CONNECT TO DATABASE:
			host: hostname
			dbname: database name
			user: username
			password: password
			port: port for POSTGRESQL server

	—>  Output in console shows time taken for each step.

—> Q4 - Write-up

	—> Integer keys - To use integer keys, I removed the ‘tt’ and ‘nm’ at the front of TitleID and PersonID respectively and changed the type to Integer.

	—> Invalid Foreign Keys - While adding new entries, I added an ‘EXISTS’ clause to check if a TitleID/PersonID actually exists in Movie/Person table before adding that entry and skipped if either one of those didn’t exist.
